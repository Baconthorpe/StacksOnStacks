# StacksOnStacks

Here's a very simple app for getting Stack Overflow questions. As this is a short exercise, the functionality is very limited and the design is spartan. There's room for improvement everywhere! If I were to continue work on it, I would start with the items below.

* Add tests. The assignment didn't mention testing, but anything with more than an hour of work in it would likely benefit from tests.
* Make the StackAPIClient class more robust. It could potentially provide an interface for different requests and greater flexibility in specifying parameters.
* Organize the project to gracefully handle a larger design. I usually have the project structure match the design, perhaps sorting files according to MVC architecture.
* Flesh out the UI and code of the view controller. While I don't know the user story here, I imagine nicer presentation wouldn't hurt. Would also want to keep the code tidy as functionality expands.
* Elaborate on error handling. There's a little bit of error handling now, but it doesn't go as far as error handling should really go, which is to consider UX.

That's what would be on the docket first. Enjoy!
